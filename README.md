# VSCode Language Package for MadX

Written by: Veronica Berglyd Olsen, CERN BE/ABP/HSS

Syntax highlighting for [MadX](http://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/) input and scripting files.

This package has been converted from the language-madx package written for Atom by the same author.

MAD (Methodical Accelerator Design) is developed and maintained at [CERN](http://cern.ch).
It is a simulation and design code for particle accelerators. This package provides syntax
highlighting for `*.madx`, `*.mask` and `*.seq` files used with this code.
